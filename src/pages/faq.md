# FAQ

- **What's the difference between MMR and RP?**

    [Official matchmaking & Ladder FAQ](https://playstormgate.com/news/stormgate-matchmaking-ladder-faq)

    ### MMR
    Each player currently has a matchmaking rating (MMR) representing their skill and a rating uncertainty that is updated after every game they play. The whole matchmaking system and ladder is built around this.

    ### RP
    RP stands for ranking points. Itâ€™s a single numerical value that is the basis of the ranking system, as the ladder is simply a sorting of players from most to least RP. At the moment, this number is based on the maximum confirmed MMR a player has achieved throughout a season, and how many wins they have accumulated in the ongoing season.
- **Why is my Ranked Points not updated?**

    At the moment we only get Ranked Points for the top 1000 players.  
    Therefore the top 1000 players are ranked by RP.  
    After position 1000 the leaderboard ranks by MMR.

    If you have a been ranked in the top 1000 but dropped out your Ranked Points will be outdated since that data is not received anymore.


- **Why am I listed as rank 1000 when I make a search?**

    If you're ranked outside of the top 1000 you Ranked Points will not be updated.  
    The search function ranks you based on points e.g if you're outside of the top 1000 your rank will be set to the maximum value whitch is 1000.
     
- **How often is the leaderboard data updated?**

    The data is updated every 60 seconds.
